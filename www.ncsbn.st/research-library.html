The ability of nurse practitioners (NPs) to provide full care is governed by state scope-of-practice (SOP) regulation, which is classified into three types: full SOP, reduced SOP, and restricted SOP. Understanding how legislative and regulatory decisions can influence supply of NPs in underserved areas can help guide effective health policies to reduce disparities in access to care.</div>

                    <div class="resource-card__text tx-medium-small tx-height-medium tx-subtle sp_sm flatten-inner-blocks trunc_5">Excessive work hours may increase fatigue in registered nurses and reduce performance and fitness to practice. The purpose of this study is to assess the prevalence of excessive work hours among College of Registered Nurses of British Columbia registrants as reported during their licensure renewal as well as the factors associated with excessive hours, including age, sex, Canadian or foreign education, area of specialization, and multiple jobs. The authors found that 6.5% of nurses (2,090 of 32,142) worked more than 2,000 hours during the study year and that 1.4% (466 of 32,142) exceeded 2,500 hours. Males; older nurses; foreign-educated nurses; critical care, operating room, geriatric, administration, education, and research nurses; and nurses with multiple jobs worked excessive hours more frequently than their counterparts. The potential for collaboration between employers and regulators is discussed.</div>

in two computer-based large-scale licensure examinations. Item preknowledge is indicated by an
unexpected short response time and a correct response. Two samples were used for detecting item
preknowledge for each examination. The first sample was from the early stage of the operational
test and was used for item calibration. The second sample was from the late stage of the
operational test, which may feature item preknowledge. The purpose of this research was to
explore whether there was evidence of item preknowledge and compromised items in the second
sample using the parameters estimated from the first sample. The results showed that for one
nonadaptive operational examination, two items (of 111) were potentially exposed, and two
candidates (of 1,172) showed some indications of preknowledge on multiple items. For another
licensure examination that featured computerized adaptive testing, there was no indication of item
preknowledge or compromised items. Implications for detected aberrant examinees and
compromised items are discussed in the article.</div>

However, existing interventions to reduce hospitalizations do not account for differences in scopes of practice among licensed nursing staff. This article describes the development of an educational innovation for nursing home staff members to learn to collaborate in ways that differentiate registered nurse and licensed practical/vocational nurse scopes of practice and strengthen connections among licensed and unlicensed nurses to improve detection and management of conditions associated with avoidable hospitalizations. The innovation was developed using situated learning theory and facilitated unfolding case discussions, reflecting the actual care environment. Evaluation data indicated the feasibility of this approach to staff education. </div>

were randomly assigned to either the study group or the control group, and all new graduate registered nurses hired between
July 1 and September 30, 2011, were invited to participate. The study hospitals adopted the National Council of State Boards
of Nursing’s Transition to Practice model program; control hospitals continued using their existing onboarding programs, which
ranged from simple orientation procedures to structured transition programs with preceptorships.

The new graduate nurses who volunteered for the transition to practice study (n = 1,088) filled out surveys at baseline,
6, 9, and 12 months after beginning their first nursing position. Competence was reported by both the new nurses and their
preceptors. New nurse self-reported data included the number of errors, safety practices, work stress, and job satisfaction.
The hospitals provided retention data on the all the new graduates hired during the study period. Though the results showed
few statistically significant differences between the two groups, when the hospitals in the control group were categorized as
having established or limited programs, differences were detected. Hospitals using established programs had higher retention
rates, and the nurses in these programs reported fewer patient care errors, employed fewer negative safety practices,
and had higher competency levels, lower stress levels, and better job satisfaction. Structured transition programs that included
at least six of the following elements were found to provide better support for newly graduated RNs: patient-centered
care, communication and teamwork, quality improvement, evidence-based practice, informatics, safety, clinical reasoning,
feedback, reflection, and specialty knowledge in an area of practice.</div>

Health care workforce forecasting models provide a mechanism for making future projections, which can be valuable in quantifying supply and demand and identifying the most appropriate strategies to prevent future shortages. Forecasts or predictions about future nursing supply and demand at the state level, although becoming more prevalent, are limited to a minority of states using a variety of methodologies. The Louisiana Multi-Regional Statewide Nursing Workforce Forecasting Model offers a unique and powerful tool to both monitor and forecast changes in the supply of, and demand for nurses at both the state and regional levels relative to specific health care settings. Development of such a model requires collaboration with agencies and/or entities having access to state-level data as well as the support of stakeholders interested in using the model in strategic planning and policy development. </div>

In nursing homes, both registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) frequently are assigned to detect medication order discrepancies, using the process of medication reconciliation. This study was undertaken to examine the extent to which licensure (RN, LPN), years of experience performing medication reconciliation, and the perceived Need for Closure were related to differences in the detection of medication order discrepancies. The Multiple Segment Factorial Vignette design was used to explore and compare nursing home nurses’ detection of such discrepancies. </div>

Hypotheses tested were related to differences in frequencies and consequences of medication error incidents between FENs and U.S.-educated nurses. The case and control groups were randomly selected from 2006 and 2010 risk management files and medication files at five Southwestern hospitals. The sample included 2,178 observations. In 2006, there were comparable percentages of FENs in the case group (34.7%) and in the control group (31.2%). In 2010, the percentages were again comparable (30.7% of FENs in the case group and 28.6% in the control group). In 2006, FENs were less likely to make medication errors not reaching patients (4.5% for FENs and 13.3% for U.S.-educated nurses), but tended to make errors reaching patients without harm (85.8% for FENs and 75.1% for U.S.-educated nurses); however, the difference disappeared in 2010. The authors’ comparison demonstrates that FENs provide quality of care comparable to that of U.S.-educated nurses with regard to medication errors, which may be attributed to the rigorous registered nurse licensure exam; FENs’ relatively higher educational background; the hospital’s recruitment, mentoring, and training programs; and the implementation of health information systems. </div>

In nursing schools, the norm has been a culture of blame in which a student, a faculty member, or both are held accountable for ENMs regardless of the source. However, evidence suggests that a failure to track and trend ENMs and learn from them actually increases the likelihood of more ENMs. To help student nurses become competent nurses, educators need systems and structures that allow trending and analysis of ENMs. Key first steps include creating a mechanism for schools to use in reporting nursingstudent ENMs and creating a transparent and blame-free culture. In addition, it will be critical to establish a national database to reflect the occurrence and types of ENMs. The database will provide a baseline of information that will guide faculty members in designing interventions to reduce ENMs. This article describes the issues and challenges encountered in creating an occurrence reporting tool, testing the tool, and establishing a national database for tracking and trending ENMs encountered by nursing students. In addition, this article presents an adaptation of the tested occurrence reporting tool that schools can use while a national database is established.</div>

A cross-sectional secondary analysis of existing national data was conducted, using counties as the unit of analysis. Data based on 1,929,414 RNs in 33 states in 2012 were obtained from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing's Nursys&reg; database, and county health data were obtained from 2,016 counties from the 2012 County Health Rankings database. Regression analysis indicated that the RN-to-population ratio along with nurse education (percentage of RNs with a BSN or higher degree) and experience (number of years since graduation) was significantly associated with the self-rated health (percentage of adults reporting fair or poor health), mammography screening rates, and teenage birth rates. The associations were all positive: Greater numbers of nurses per capita were associated with better population health indices. These results are consistent with the Nurse Dose concept and support the need for enhanced recognition and policy changes regarding the contribution of nurses to the health of the population. Implications for nursing regulation include the need for sustained and coordinated efforts to support the health of the population through the recruitment and maintenance of a well educated and experienced nursing workforce.</div>

The aim of the study was to evaluate nursing workforce attitudes, receptivity, confidence, competency, knowledge, and practices regarding genomics. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistical techniques. Respondents were 7,798 licensed registered nurses. The majority (89%) said it was very or somewhat important for nurses to become more educated in the genetics of common diseases. Overall, the respondents felt genomics was important, but a genomic nursing competency deficit affecting all nurses regardless of academic preparation or role was observed.

                    <div class="resource-card__text tx-medium-small tx-height-medium tx-subtle sp_sm flatten-inner-blocks trunc_5">The use of unlicensed assistive personnel (UAP) in hospitals has increased over the last 20 years. In lieu of regulation of UAP by boards of nursing, many health care agencies and organizations have developed their own educational standards, role definitions, and scopes of practice for UAP in acute care. The purpose of this study was to explore how UAP are used in acute care settings and how their work is perceived by nurses who work with them and by themselves. The results of this mixed method design study showed many similarities among UAP titling; however, there were substantial variations in educational preparation and use of UAP, especially as they move into advanced or specialty areas. Nevertheless, both registered nurses and UAP perceive the work of UAP to be highly effective. Additional collaborative research by regulatory and health care agencies is recommended. This research should be used to inform the development of regulations for educational preparation and utilization of these providers.</div>

                    <div class="resource-card__text tx-medium-small tx-height-medium tx-subtle sp_sm flatten-inner-blocks trunc_5">This study aimed to describe state regulatory certified nursing assistant (CNA) oversight in two domains—use of registry or licensing for credentialing and initial CNA training and continuing education (CE) requirements—and to evaluate whether CNA oversight is associated with resident outcomes in nursing homes. This cross-sectional secondary analysis combined 2004 data on state-level regulatory requirements for CNA oversight, training, and CE with nursing home resident outcomes data collected in 2004 from 16,125 U.S. facilities in 49 states. Though 26 states required CNAs to have more initial training hours than the federal requirement of 75 hours, only four states required additional yearly CE hours to maintain CNA certification. The combination of increased initial training and annual CE hours was significantly associated with nursing homes reporting lower antidepressant and antipsychotic use and lower average medication use. Use of a registry or licensing board for credentialing was significantly related to lower catheter use, and CNA licensure was significantly associated with lower odds of falls. Findings suggest that regulatory modifications could be beneficial to improve resident care outcomes in nursing homes.</div>

Data collection from the most recent, and final, NSSRN was completed in 2008; hence, there is no current data on the nationwide supply of RNs. This current project was conducted by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing and the Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers to fill this ongoing need and is titled, The National Council of State Boards of Nursing and The Forum of State Nursing Workforce Centers 2013 National Workforce Survey of RNs. This article presents the highlights of the study and its results.

Outcomes examined were program completion, NCLEX-RN &reg; passage, subsequent criminal acts, and subsequent professional misconduct. A retrospective descriptive-comparative research design was used. The sample consisted of 3,166 applicants from the 2006 cohort of preRN licensure students in Louisiana who met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Analysis of the data revealed 10% of participants with a criminal history had a subsequent criminal incident, whereas only 3.4% of the noncriminal history group had a subsequent criminal incident. Additionally, 4.5% of the criminal history group had subsequent professional misconduct compared with 1% of the noncriminal history group.</div>

We evaluated 861 cases submitted by BONs to the NCSBN’s Taxonomy of Error, Root Cause Analysis, and Practice-Responsibility database. Standard statistical analysis was used. A high percentage of nurses involved in practice breakdowns that were reported to BONs have a negative job history (discipline or termination for practice issues by their employers). Among the 725 nurses with complete job histories available, 60% (n = 437) had been disciplined or terminated by their employers in the past. A nurse's job history may serve as a useful index to identify a small group of nurses with a risk of being involved in a practice breakdown. In addition to conventional disciplinary actions, a tailored remediation program should be considered to prevent additional practice breakdowns.</div>

This article provides results of a study conducted by the Alabama Board of Nursing regarding the views of 600 consumers on advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). Less than 20% of participants knew the agency responsible for regulating APRNs, but the expectations for public safety were explicit regarding preparation for practice and competence.</div>

The variability in the required number of credits alone is a prompt for educators to examine the most efficient path to a graduate degree for non-nurses. Further, those involved in the design, implementation, and regulation of these programs and the students need to consider the actual and potential regulatory issues that can surface when students without a nursing degree are permitted or required to take the NCLEX after completing pregraduate nursing courses.</div>
